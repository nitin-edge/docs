# Authentication

The Taxonomy API uses Bearer Token authentication to secure your requests. This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining and using your API key.

## Obtaining an API Key

To get your API key:

1. [Sign up](#) for a Taxonomy API account if you haven't already.
2. Navigate to the API Keys section in your dashboard.
3. Click on "Generate New API Key".
4. Copy your new API key and store it securely. Note that for security reasons, you won't be able to view this key again.

## Using Your API Key

To authenticate your requests, include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/functions" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Best Practices

To keep your API key secure:

1. Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control.
2. Use environment variables to store your API key in your applications.
3. Rotate your API key regularly, especially if you suspect it may have been compromised.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, the Taxonomy API implements rate limiting. The current limits are:

- 1000 requests per minute
- 10,000 requests per day

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response. The response will include headers indicating your current rate limit status.

## Need Help?

If you're having trouble authenticating or need to request higher rate limits, please [contact our support team](mailto:support@yourdomain.com).

Remember, your API key is a secret. If you believe your key has been compromised, regenerate it immediately from your dashboard.
